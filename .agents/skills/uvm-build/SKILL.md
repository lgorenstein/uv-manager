# uvm-build — execute the roadmap (resume-and-implement)

## When to Use

Invoke `/uvm-build` on a feature/fix branch whose `spec/{slug}/TECH.md` exists, to execute the next
slice of the roadmap without re-explaining the project. The rhythm is **one-phase-then-stop**: scale up
with arguments when you trust the next chunk, scale down to a dry run when you do not. `TECH.md`
frontmatter is the resume ground truth; `PLAN.md` is the authoritative design; `GOAL.md` R-IDs are the
locked contract; `research/` holds detail. Track progress **only** in `TECH.md`, via the scripts.

Reference: [`methodology.md`](../../factory/methodology.md),
[`invariants.md`](../../factory/invariants.md), and `AGENTS.md` (the constitution).

**Harness portability.** Runs on any harness — see [`portability.md`](../../factory/portability.md).
If the *Current state* block is not auto-injected, run those commands yourself in Step 1, which
already re-runs `next_phase.py`. Nothing else here is Claude-specific.

## User Instructions

Additional instructions provided with the invocation: $ARGUMENTS

## Current state (injected at load)

- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Tree: !`git status --porcelain | head -n 20`
- Commits on branch (vs main): !`git log --oneline main..HEAD 2>/dev/null | head -n 15`
- FSM: resolved in **Step 1** by running `uv run .agents/factory/bin/next_phase.py spec/{slug}/TECH.md` (a load-time injection cannot strip the branch prefix to form `{slug}`).

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` case-insensitively; if ambiguous, STOP and ask.

- `status` / `report` → summarize FSM state (via `next_phase.py`, Step 1) plus the last commit; no
  work.
- `dry run` / `plan only` / `preview` → identify the target phase and load context, but make **no**
  edits or commits. Report the plan: checklist items, files, verify command, expected commit.
- `phase P<n>` / `at P<n>` → execute that phase regardless of `current_phase`.
- `through P<n>` / `up to P<n>` → execute forward, stopping after `P<n>` completes.
- `next N` / `N phases` → execute the next `N` incomplete phases, each its own commit.
- `bundle` → collapse the run into a single commit. Only for tightly coupled phases.
- `no-pause` → continue past the natural phase-boundary stop. Use sparingly.
- No arguments → default next-phase-then-stop.

## Safety Principles

- **`next_phase.py` is the resume ground truth**, re-run fresh every invocation in Step 1. If it
  reports the FSM invalid, or warns of pointer/status drift, **reconcile before acting** — do not
  guess.
- **On a feature/fix branch only** — never `main`. Clean tree required; non-empty → STOP (commit,
  stash, or discard first).
- **A phase is the unit of work.** Execute every `[ ]` item in the target phase, not just the first. A
  phase is `done` only when all items are satisfied **and** its `verify:` command passes.
- **Verify by driving the script, in a sandbox.** Run the phase's `verify:` command. Anything
  behavioral goes through `.agents/factory/bin/temp_root.sh` — never a bare `bin/uvm install`, which
  writes into the developer's real state root and can pull hundreds of megabytes. **Exit 0 is
  necessary but not sufficient:** assert the concrete post-condition (a `readlink` on `current`, a path
  that exists, a version string, a specific line on stderr). A drive that "completed" but left the
  wrong tree is a FAIL. A still-red gate is a STOP — do not mark the phase done or advance state.
- **Amend `TECH.md` freely; the GOAL is locked.** When reality diverges from the plan — a phase is
  wrong, needs splitting, or a new one is required — rewrite `TECH.md` (regenerate frontmatter with
  `set_phase.py`, edit phase bodies as needed) and **note the amendment in the commit body**. But if
  the work contradicts a `GOAL.md` R-ID, **STOP and escalate** — never silently drift the contract.
- **Honor `AGENTS.md`.** The invariants for the region you are touching (consult `invariants.md`), the
  same-commit rule (`uvm_help`, `README.md`, `etc/uv-manager.conf.example`,
  `share/modulefiles/uv/main.lua`), the single version source, and the **prose and comment voice** —
  declarative statements of the *why*, no filler or marketing adjectives, no emoji, and **no
  feature-scoped spec ids (`R1`, `P3`) in `bin/uv-manager` or `README.md`**.
- **Prefer deleting to adding.** If a phase can be satisfied by removing a special case rather than
  adding one, do that and say so in the commit body.
- **Circuit breaker (durable).** Every gate that stays red is recorded on file via
  `set_phase.py --phase {id} --record-attempt` — the counter, not session memory, trips the breaker.
  When a phase's `attempts` reaches about 3 (`next_phase.py` warns), or it stays `hill: uphill` across
  builds, **stop and re-shape**: STOP and recommend `/uvm-plan` or human input rather than looping.
- **`main` is off-limits; never push, squash, force-push, or open PRs** — that is `/uvm-publish`. Keep
  the `Co-Authored-By` trailer.

## Procedure

### Step 0 — status / dry-run (when requested)
`status`: run `next_phase.py` (Step 1), report the FSM plus the last commit, and stop. `dry run`: do
Steps 1–2, then report the plan that *would* run and stop — no edits, no commits.

### Step 1 — Pre-flight
1. Clean tree on a feature/fix branch, from the injection. STOP otherwise.
2. Resolve `{slug}` from the branch, then run
   `uv run .agents/factory/bin/next_phase.py spec/{slug}/TECH.md` and read its output. If it errored or
   warned of drift, reconcile (`set_phase.py --current …`) or STOP and report.
3. **Remediation mode.** If the FSM shows `top_status: blocked` or
   `review.verdict: changes-requested`, a prior `/uvm-review` requested changes. Read
   `spec/{slug}/REVIEW.md`, then make the fixes actionable by amending `TECH.md`. **Prefer reopening**
   the existing phase whose `satisfies` covers the failing R-IDs
   (`set_phase.py --phase P<n> --phase-status in_progress`). A reopened phase's gate is retuned the
   same script-safe way — tighten a too-weak `verify:` with `set_phase.py --phase P<n> --verify "…"`,
   never by hand-editing the YAML. Only if a fix maps to no existing phase, add one **through the
   script**: `set_phase.py --add-phase P<next> --name "F# remediation: …" --satisfies R<n>
   --depends-on P<m> --verify "…"`, then write its checklist body and re-validate with
   `next_phase.py`. Set `--top-status in_progress` and proceed. If a finding contradicts a `GOAL.md`
   R-ID rather than just the plan, STOP and escalate instead.

   A remediation edit is not local to its phase. After making it, re-run the `verify:` of every `done`
   phase whose gate exercises a function the edit touched — in a single-file project that is normally
   all of them — and reopen any that goes red. `depends_on` answers a different question: it encodes
   build order, and when every phase edits the same function that order says almost nothing about
   which gates a fix invalidates. `next_phase.py`
   never re-runs a gate, so a `done` phase whose assertion the fix invalidated is invisible to the FSM
   and ships green. The shape that breaks is a reconciliation phase whose gate hardcodes a count the
   fix just moved.

### Step 2 — Identify target phase + load context
1. Target = the `next_phase` output from Step 1, or the argument-selected phase. Confirm its
   `depends_on` are `done`; if not, STOP.
2. Read `spec/{slug}/PLAN.md` and the relevant `research/` for the detail behind the phase's checklist.
   **Read the region of `bin/uv-manager` the phase will touch before editing it**, including the
   banner comment above it — the comments carry the constraints that are not visible from the code.

### Step 3 — Implement the phase
Execute every `[ ]` item to `AGENTS.md` conventions. Sanity-check as you go: `bash -n bin/uv-manager`
after any non-trivial edit is nearly free and catches the class of error that a shell script fails on
at the worst possible moment. If implementation reveals a real correction to `TECH.md`/`PLAN.md`, amend
`TECH.md` per Step 5. If it reveals a `GOAL.md` contradiction, STOP and escalate.

When a phase introduces a shell primitive the script does not already use, check it against
`invariants.md` §10 and grep `bin/uv-manager` for an existing use *before* designing around it. One
grep: the floor forbids what the syscall underneath happily provides — `rename(2)` is atomic and
exclusive, `mv -T` does not exist at the floor — and `uvm_point_current` already carries the
documented fallback that says so.

A mechanism whose evidence is a *rate* rather than a post-condition is re-measured at the researched
size before its box is checked. A brief reporting zero failures over 3648 ranks has a confidence
interval, and a defect at 1 burst in 40 is invisible to a run that did 40; a gate answers for a
post-condition and cannot speak to a distribution. Disagreement with the brief is a finding about the
brief.

A design decision that is the maintainer's but does not touch `GOAL.md` is the middle case between
amending `TECH.md` and escalating a `GOAL.md` contradiction, and it has one shape: state the options
and their blast radius, ask, and record the answer as a dated line in the phase body the way
`GOAL.md` records a clarification. Do not leave unchecked boxes describing work nobody has agreed
to — a reversal then has nowhere to attach.

### Step 4 — Verify gate
Run the phase's `verify:` command, plus any additional drive the change warrants. "Green" means **the
asserted post-condition held** — the observed tree, symlink target, exit code or stderr line is
correct — not merely that the command exited 0.

A **new or retuned** `verify:` gets one step before you trust it: run it under `/bin/sh`, and confirm
it is red before the fix and green after.
```
uv run .agents/factory/bin/run_verify.py spec/{slug}/TECH.md --phase {id}
```
That reads the gate out of the folded YAML and execs it as `/bin/sh -c '…'`, erroring rather than
exiting 0 when the string is empty. Copying a wrapped gate by hand means reflowing it, and reflowing is
where a quoting error enters; `/bin/sh -c ''` exits 0, so a reader that silently produced nothing
satisfies the red check while proving nothing. The string is authored in this session's interactive
shell and executed later by `lint.sh`, by CI, and by anyone reading `TECH.md` under plain `sh`, where
aliases, shell functions and GNU-versus-BSD utilities all diverge — a `grep` that is a shell function
here is `/usr/bin/grep` there. A gate never observed failing is not a gate.

A phase that adds a constraint — a refusal, a guard, anything that narrows legal inputs — invalidates
gate *setups* elsewhere, and not only when a review sent you back. Re-run the `verify:` of every other
phase, `done` and `pending` alike: a red `done` gate is invisible to the FSM and ships green, and a
`pending` gate may have been written against inputs the constraint has since made illegal. The two
outcomes differ — a gate whose *setup* the constraint outlawed is retuned and its phase stays `done`;
a gate whose *assertion* the change broke reopens the phase.

Green → proceed. A red you can name the correction for is the inner loop of implementation: make the
fix, re-run, and record what it took in the commit body, not as an attempt — the counter catches a
phase that will not converge, and one converging exactly as planned would trip it in three reds. A
gate that stays red — no correction left to try, or the one you predicted would clear it did not —
says the phase is mis-shaped → STOP; do not mark done or advance state. Record the failure:
```
uv run .agents/factory/bin/set_phase.py spec/{slug}/TECH.md --phase {id} --record-attempt --touch
```
and commit at least that `TECH.md` change before handing back, so the circuit breaker counts across
sessions.

### Step 5 — Update `TECH.md` (the resume contract)
1. Check off the phase's `[ ]` items in the body.
2. Advance state with the script — regenerate, never hand-edit the YAML:
   ```
   uv run .agents/factory/bin/set_phase.py spec/{slug}/TECH.md \
       --phase {id} --phase-status done --current {next_id_or_done} --touch
   ```
   For a mid-phase amendment, edit phase bodies and use `set_phase.py` for any status, pointer or hill
   change. If all phases are now done, also pass `--top-status in_review`; otherwise, if the top status
   is still `planned`, this is the branch's first completed phase — pass `--top-status in_progress`.

### Step 6 — Meta-note (self-improvement loop · silence by default)
Before committing, reflect on the **skillset itself** — not the task, not the code. Write nothing
unless the bar is met.

**The bar (one test):** *was this the skill's fault — not mine, not the task's?* **Qualifies:** you
hand-fixed a command this skill gave (a wrong flag or path, a bare `python` that should be `uv run`,
a drive that should have gone through `temp_root.sh`, unquoted YAML); a genuinely ambiguous
instruction; a verify gate that passed or failed misleadingly (exit 0 hid a wrong final tree); an
allowed-tools/step mismatch. **Stay silent for:** a merely hard task; your own error against clear
guidance; a one-off code issue (that goes in `REVIEW.md` at review time); a vague preference.

If, and only if, the bar is met, record it in `spec/{slug}/META.md` — create from
[`templates/META.md`](../../factory/templates/META.md) if absent, else append. You may also add a
one-line **What worked well** note. Caps: at most three findings, terse; append "· seen again" rather
than duplicating (recurrence across phases is exactly the signal `/uvm-harness` acts on); a fix that
would weaken a non-negotiable gate (`lint.sh`, the sandbox drive, an `invariants.md` item) is
`severity=high` and must say so. **Records only.** Next unused `F#`, always `status=open`, appended
**outside** any code fence:

```markdown
## F<n> — <one-line title>
`origin=uvm-build:{id} severity=<high|medium|low> category=<instruction|steering|tooling|template|missing-guidance> status=open target=<best-guess file>`
- **What happened:** <what the skill made you do, or fail to do>.
- **Skill cause:** <why it's the instructions' fault — not yours, not the task's>.
- **Recommended fix:** <the change to the skill/template/script>.
- **Confidence:** <high|med|low> · **Effort:** <small|medium|large>
```

`uvm-build` is **the richest source** and runs **per phase across separate invocations** — appending to
the file, not to memory, is exactly how you preserve a finding a context reset would erase. The note
rides in this phase's atomic commit below.

### Step 7 — Commit (atomic code + state)
```
git add -A
git commit -m "[{category}] Build {slug} {id}: {phase name}"
```
`{category}` is the `AGENTS.md` category of this branch's **shape commit** — the oldest entry in the
*Commits on branch* injection — which is what `/uvm-plan` follows too. Fall back to `kind` only when no
prior branch commit exists. The two are different taxonomies: `kind` has no `docs` or `harness` member,
and a documentation cycle, which the same-commit rule produces often, is exactly where they diverge.
There is **no `WIP:` prefix**: every branch commit is squashed into the single PR-title commit at `/uvm-publish`, so
subjects only need to read well in the PR's commits tab. For a remediation commit, keep the `{id}` and
describe the fix, e.g. `[fix] Build {slug} P1: F1 — honor the platform override in trampolines (R4)`.
Use the body for non-obvious decisions, for a `TECH.md` amendment, or to record what was removed. Keep
the `Co-Authored-By` trailer. Do not push. `bundle` → one commit for the whole run.

### Step 8 — Continue or stop
Default, or at a phase boundary: stop and report. `through`/`next`/multi: loop to Step 2 with the next
phase until the stop condition, a phase boundary (unless `no-pause`), or a STOP from Steps 3–4.

### Final report
Phases completed (ids plus one-line summaries), any `TECH.md` amendments and why, any `[ ]` deferred,
the new `current_phase` and statuses, verify-gate results with the post-conditions actually observed,
and open questions or blockers. When the FSM is fully done (`status: in_review`), recommend a
**clean-session** `/uvm-review`.

## Examples

- `/uvm-build` — next incomplete phase, run its verify, one clean commit, stop and report.
- `/uvm-build status` — FSM state plus last commit; no work.
- `/uvm-build dry run phase P3` — report what P3 would do; no edits.
- `/uvm-build through P3` — run each incomplete phase up to P3, one commit each.

## Notes

- Never advance state on a checkbox alone, and never on exit 0 alone. The asserted post-condition is
  the gate.
- Keep `current_phase` accurate even when stopping mid-phase on a STOP condition; do not advance past
  a partially done phase.
- This skill never ships to `main`, squashes, or force-pushes — that is `/uvm-publish`. Out of scope
  (`merge`, `push`, `open PR`, `bump version`) → STOP and point at `/uvm-publish` or `/uvm-release`.
