# uvm-plan — research → PLAN → TECH

## When to Use

Invoke `/uvm-plan` after `/uvm-feature` has landed a quality `GOAL.md` on a feature/fix branch. It
produces the design (`PLAN.md`), optional backing `research/`, and the phased FSM (`TECH.md`), then
stops for your sign-off before `/uvm-build` touches code. Depth scales to the GOAL's `appetite`.

Reference: [`methodology.md`](../../factory/methodology.md),
[`invariants.md`](../../factory/invariants.md) (the gate), and the templates
[`PLAN.md`](../../factory/templates/PLAN.md) / [`TECH.md`](../../factory/templates/TECH.md).

**Harness portability.** Runs on any harness — see [`portability.md`](../../factory/portability.md).
Fallbacks: if the *Current state* block is not auto-injected, run those commands yourself in Step 1;
ask in plain text and STOP if `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable; and **if subagents are unavailable or
the session disallows them, do the research fan-out sequentially yourself** (Step 3 gives the
fallback).

## User Instructions

Additional instructions provided with the invocation: $ARGUMENTS

## Current state (injected at load)

- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Tree: !`git status --porcelain | head -n 20`
- Spec artifacts: !`ls -1 spec/*/ 2>/dev/null | head -n 40`

## Argument Parsing

- `skip research` / `no research` → collapse to a lean plan (no fan-out) regardless of appetite.
- `appetite small|big` → override the GOAL's appetite for this planning run.
- `status` / `report` → summarize what artifacts already exist for this slug and what is missing; no
  work.

## Safety Principles

- **On a feature/fix branch, never `main`.** Derive `{slug}` = branch minus its `feature/`|`fix/`
  prefix. STOP if on the base branch or the tree is dirty.
- **`GOAL.md` must exist, be committed, and carry no unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers.** If
  markers remain, STOP and send the human back to `/uvm-feature`.
- **Research is strictly read-only.** Bias it to three sources in this order: the script itself,
  `README.md` § *Design notes* (the record of rejected alternatives), and `uv`'s own documentation or
  source. Reach for the web only for genuinely external unknowns — Astral's installer behavior, an
  open `astral-sh/uv` issue, a filesystem semantic.
- **Never build.** No edits to `bin/uv-manager`. That is `/uvm-build`. A throwaway copy outside the
  working tree is not a build: it is the sanctioned way to prove a `verify:` gate can go green.
- **The invariant gate is mandatory**, at both checkpoints. Any bend gets recorded in PLAN's deviation
  table, never applied silently.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Pre-flight & load
1. Confirm feature/fix branch and clean tree; resolve `{slug}`.
2. Read `spec/{slug}/GOAL.md` (appetite, R-IDs, non-goals) and
   [`invariants.md`](../../factory/invariants.md).

### Step 2 — Invariant gate #1 (pre-research sanity)
Given the GOAL's intent, list the invariant sections (§1–§12) this change will touch and confirm the
intent is even sane against them. A change to provisioning must respect the version-authoritative pin
and the lock's early-out; a change to anything a modulefile touches must respect architecture
neutrality. If the GOAL is fundamentally at odds with an invariant, STOP and escalate.

### Step 3 — Research fan-out (appetite-scaled)

Appetite governs the depth; `kind` does not. `/uvm-feature` already folded `kind` into it, so a fix
carrying `appetite: big` fans out like any other big change.

- **`appetite: small` / `skip research`:** skip the fan-out. Do at most a couple of targeted reads
  yourself, and proceed to Step 4 with a lean plan; `research/` may be omitted.

  **Exception — diagnostic fixes.** When the GOAL's root cause is *unknown*, or it explicitly requests
  diagnosis, run the full fan-out regardless of `kind`/`appetite`. For such a fix the investigation
  *is* the deliverable, and skipping it yields a guess. `kind` and `appetite` are proxies for "is the
  root cause known?"; when they disagree with the GOAL, the GOAL wins.

  **Exception — high blast radius.** Run the full fan-out whenever the change can alter what a
  high-blast-radius region on `invariants.md`'s list *does* (`uvm_acquire_lock`, `uvm_install`,
  `uvm_point_current`, `uvm_resolve_root`, `uvm_trampolines`, `uvm_export_env`, the dispatch tail),
  regardless of appetite. A "small" edit there still needs the exact contracts pinned before design.
  The trigger is behavioral, not positional: a pass provably confined to comments, message strings or
  documentation scales research to appetite instead. Message text is the near miss — a string a region
  named in `invariants.md` §3 or §7 prints is user-facing behavior, so capture the pre-change output as
  a `research/` baseline even when the fan-out is skipped.

  Unlike the diagnostic exception above, the GOAL does not simply win here: this exception exists
  because a human can under-scope an edit in this region. A GOAL that argues for less — an appetite, a
  clarification, a criterion it says covers the risk — narrows the fan-out's breadth but does not
  eliminate it. Run the narrowed fan-out and say in `PLAN.md` what it was narrowed to, and why.

  An explicit `skip research` argument stays a human override and still skips.

- **`appetite: big`:** identify the *rabbit holes* — the unknowns that could blow the appetite. In this
  project they are usually one of: a filesystem semantic that must be verified rather than assumed
  (atomic rename, `flock`, reflink, `stat` flavors); an `uv` or `install.sh` behavior that has to be
  read out of Astral's source or driven in the sandbox; a `bash` portability question between 3.2 and
  5; or a cluster behavior that cannot be reproduced locally and needs a stated assumption.

  Launch **read-only research subagents in parallel** (`Agent`), one per topic, breadth-first:
  - Each gets the topic, GOAL context, explicit scope boundaries, and the instruction to produce a
    brief of roughly one to two thousand tokens and **write it to
    `spec/{slug}/research/NN-topic.md`** — use `general-purpose` so it can write, and number `01`,
    `02`, … with distinct paths so there are no write conflicts.
  - A research agent **may** drive the script read-only through
    `.agents/factory/bin/temp_root.sh`; that is the cheapest way to answer "what does it actually do".
    It must not edit tracked files.
  - Scale count to appetite. Log what you fan out.
  - **Consume each agent's returned summary; never read its transcript sidecar** — it floods context.
    **No fan-out available?** Whether the harness lacks subagents or the session disallows spawning
    them, do the research yourself, sequentially, writing the same files. The deliverable is the same.
- Read the returned briefs and synthesize **`spec/{slug}/research/00-digest.md`** — the consolidated
  decisions, resolving any cross-brief contradiction with a single recommendation each.

### Step 4 — Write `PLAN.md`
From the template: **Summary**; **Design** at the right altitude, naming the functions in
`bin/uv-manager` that change and what the state tree looks like afterwards; the **requirement → design
map** with every R-ID covered; **rabbit holes resolved** (link the briefs); **risks and open
questions**, including anything only a real cluster can confirm; and the **verification strategy**
that seeds each phase's `verify:` command.

State explicitly what is being **removed**. A change that only adds is worth a second look in this
repository.

### Step 5 — Invariant gate #2 (post-design)
Re-walk the touched invariant sections against the *drafted design*. Fill PLAN's deviation
justification table for anything that bends an invariant or adds complexity, naming the simpler
alternative and why it was rejected. Empty is the goal. STOP and escalate on an unavoidable conflict
with a §1–§11 invariant.

### Step 6 — Generate `TECH.md` (the FSM)
Copy the template. Author phases as **vertical slices, not horizontal layers** — each independently
verifiable end to end, ordered core-and-novel first.

With the phases drafted, re-read § *Invariant gate* against every checklist item and ask of each gate
bullet: which phase would violate this? The gate is written in one pass and the checklists in another,
and nothing otherwise reconciles them, so an item landing on the wrong side of a constraint the same
document just asserted reaches `/uvm-build` unchallenged.

**Size circuit-breaker (soft):** if the roadmap needs more than about six phases for a single 850-line
script, the scope is probably too big — pause and reconsider with the human before committing a
mega-plan.

For each phase set `id`, `name`, `satisfies` (R-IDs), `depends_on`, `parallel` (**almost always
`false`** — there is one source file, so two phases editing it are not independent; reserve `true` for
documentation-only or modulefile-only phases), `hammerable` (**false** for anything touching
`invariants.md` §1–§11), `hill: uphill`, and a real `verify:` command.

A `verify:` must name a **post-condition**, not merely exit 0. Build it from the three layers:
`bash -n`, `.agents/factory/bin/lint.sh`, and a drive under `.agents/factory/bin/temp_root.sh`
(`--offline` for anything touching provisioning, `--arch` for anything touching the architecture
split). Any change to the user-facing surface gets a phase item for the same-commit rule —
`uvm_help`, `README.md`, `etc/uv-manager.conf.example`, `share/modulefiles/uv/main.lua`. A design that
overturns an invariant gets one for `AGENTS.md` § *Invariants* and `.agents/factory/invariants.md`:
Step 5's deviation row records the bend, and the phase that lands the code has to make those records
true, or `/uvm-review` grades correct code against the decision it reversed.

Then read each phase's `verify:` back against that phase's own checklist and against the *Checked by*
clause of every R-ID in `satisfies`, both directions. A clause naming two checks is not covered by a
gate asserting one, and where the phase satisfies a criterion in two places — a printed block and the
advisory line beside it — the gate names each. A gate can
**contradict** an item: `! git grep -q OLD_NAME` goes red the moment the same phase adds the design
note that has to name `OLD_NAME` to explain itself. A gate can also be **blind** to one, which is the
quieter failure — a phase mixing mechanical items with judgment items gets a gate shaped by the
mechanical ones, goes green, and the judgment item ships unchecked. An enumerated pathspec against a
universally-quantified criterion — "wherever it is stated", "every", "no file" — is that same failure
wearing a scope: the gate carries the criterion's quantifier, repository-wide with literal exclusions,
and each exclusion earns its reason in the phase body. Reconcile at plan time: narrow the gate's
pathspec, extend it, or state in the phase body that an item — or the part of a *Checked by* clause
no command can decide — is inspection-only so `/uvm-review` reads it rather than trusting the gate.

Then run every `verify:` against the current tree before committing the plan. A gate asserting a
post-condition the phase has not yet delivered must exit **non-zero**; one that exits 0 here is inert
until proven otherwise, and will still be inert when `/uvm-build` reads its green as done. A
*regression* gate inverts this and is legitimate: a criterion demanding that behavior not change is
green before and after by construction, and contorting it into a red destroys what it measures. Such a
gate is exempt from the red requirement; its phase is not. A phase carrying only regression gates owes
at least one post-condition that is red today, or nothing about it is falsifiable. The failure
that motivates this is silent: a census gate whose pathspec is interpolated from a variable searches
one nonexistent path under `zsh`, which does not word-split, and reports a clean tree with thirteen
hits in it. Write the paths literally. A prose anchor fails the same way: `git grep` matches within
a line, and `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` hard-wrap near 100 columns, so a phrase long enough to be
unique often spans two of them and never matches — the gate asserting a sentence is gone reads green
while the sentence is still there. Confirm the anchor matches the file as it stands before gating on
its absence.

Under `set -e`, POSIX exempts `! cmd` from errexit: `sh -c 'set -e; ! true; echo REACHED'` prints
`REACHED` and exits 0. A `! cmd` that is the gate's last command, or a link in an `&&` chain, still
reports its status — most committed gates use it that way and are correct. Appending a drive after
one silently disables it, and the gate then goes green with the assertion unmet. There, write
`if cmd; then echo "FAIL: …" >&2; exit 1; fi`, which also names the post-condition that failed.

Red is necessary, not sufficient. Read the failure output and confirm the gate died on the asserted
post-condition rather than on itself — a typo, a missing flag, a tool that is not installed, a string
the YAML layer mangled. In a multi-clause gate, confirm it died on the *first* unmet clause: output
from a later clause means an earlier assertion ran without aborting — usually a bare `! cmd` with
something after it — and the gate turns green the day those later clauses pass. A gate red for its own
reasons stays red through the build, walking `--record-attempt` toward the circuit breaker at 3 while
the code is correct. When the output does not
settle it, prove the gate can go green: copy the repository outside the working tree
(`cp -R . "$(mktemp -d)/probe"`), apply the phase's change to the copy, and run the gate from inside
it.

Set top `status: planned`, `current_phase` to the first phase, and `last_updated` to today. The plan is
written but not signed off; `/uvm-build` flips the top status to `in_progress` when it completes the
first phase. Then **validate**: `uv run .agents/factory/bin/next_phase.py spec/{slug}/TECH.md` must
exit 0 and report the first phase.

### Step 7 — Meta-note (self-improvement loop · silence by default)
Before committing, reflect on the **skillset itself** — not the task, not the code. Write nothing
unless the bar is met.

**The bar (one test):** *was this the skill's fault — not mine, not the task's?* **Qualifies:** you
hand-fixed a command this skill gave (wrong flag or path, unquoted `verify:` YAML); a genuinely
ambiguous instruction; a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` better guidance could have pre-empted; an
allowed-tools/step mismatch; a gate that passed or failed misleadingly. **Stay silent for:** a merely
hard task; your own error against clear guidance; a one-off content or code issue (that goes in
`PLAN.md`/`GOAL.md`); a vague preference.

If, and only if, the bar is met, record it in `spec/{slug}/META.md` — create from
[`templates/META.md`](../../factory/templates/META.md) if absent, else append. You may also add a
one-line **What worked well** note. Caps: at most three findings, terse; append "· seen again" rather
than duplicating an equivalent finding; a fix that would weaken a non-negotiable gate (the invariant
gate, the `verify:` design, an `invariants.md` item) is `severity=high` and must say so. **Records
only.** Use the next unused `F#`, always `status=open`, appended **outside** any code fence:

```markdown
## F<n> — <one-line title>
`origin=uvm-plan:<step> severity=<high|medium|low> category=<instruction|steering|tooling|template|missing-guidance> status=open target=<best-guess file>`
- **What happened:** <what the skill made you do, or fail to do>.
- **Skill cause:** <why it's the instructions' fault — not yours, not the task's>.
- **Recommended fix:** <the change to the skill/template/script>.
- **Confidence:** <high|med|low> · **Effort:** <small|medium|large>
```

Likely sources here: the research fan-out mechanics (Step 3), the invariant-gate steps, or `TECH.md`
YAML authoring.

### Step 8 — Commit
```
git add -A spec/{slug}      # PLAN.md + TECH.md, plus research/ and META.md when present
git commit -m "[{category}] Plan {slug}: design + phased roadmap"
```
`{category}` is the same category as the shape commit. Keep the `Co-Authored-By` trailer. Do not push.

### Step 9 — Report & hand off
Report the design summary, the phase list (id · name · satisfies · verify), any deviations recorded,
and open risks — especially anything that can only be confirmed on a real cluster. Sign-off gate: the
human reviews `PLAN.md` and `TECH.md`, then `/uvm-build` executes phase one. Stop.

## Examples

- `/uvm-plan` — full appetite-scaled run for the current branch's slug.
- `/uvm-plan skip research` — lean plan for a small change, no fan-out.
- `/uvm-plan status` — list existing GOAL/research/PLAN/TECH for this slug and what is missing.

## Notes

- Keep `research/` lean. Reviewers and future readers pay a tax for sprawl; keep only what informs the
  design.
- `TECH.md` is the resume ground truth for `/uvm-build`. If `next_phase.py` reports it invalid, fix it
  before committing.
- A research brief that concludes "we cannot test this locally" is a useful brief. Record the
  assumption in PLAN §5 rather than inventing a verification that does not verify anything.
