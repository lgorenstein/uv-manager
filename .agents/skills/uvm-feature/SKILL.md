# uvm-feature — shape the goal

## When to Use

Invoke `/uvm-feature` on a clean `main` to begin a new unit of work. It produces exactly one artifact
— a refined `spec/{slug}/GOAL.md` on a fresh branch — and stops for your sign-off before the expensive
`/uvm-plan` step. This is **shaping** in the Shape Up sense: make the goal coherent, bounded and
unambiguous, but leave design freedom for the plan. Do **not** research or read a lot of code here.

Reference, loaded only if needed: [`methodology.md`](../../factory/methodology.md),
[`ears.md`](../../factory/ears.md), and the template
[`templates/GOAL.md`](../../factory/templates/GOAL.md).

**Harness portability.** These skills run on any harness, not only Claude Code — see
[`portability.md`](../../factory/portability.md). Here the Claude-specific affordances degrade
gracefully: if the *Current state* block below is not auto-injected, run those commands yourself in
Step 1; if `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable, ask in plain text and STOP. Everything else is portable
shell.

## User Instructions

Additional instructions provided with the invocation: $ARGUMENTS

## Current state (injected at load)

- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Tree: !`git status --porcelain | head -n 20`
- Untracked GOAL.md files: !`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard 'spec/**/GOAL.md'`
- Open issues: !`git ls-files 'issues/*.md'`

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` case-insensitively. If self-contradictory, STOP and ask.

- A path matching `spec/<slug>/GOAL.md` → **adopt that file** as the seed; `{slug}` comes from the
  path. This is the "I hand-wrote a GOAL.md" flow.
- A path matching `issues/<slug>.md` (or `.security/issues/<slug>.md`) → **promote that issue**.
  `{slug}` is the file stem; its frontmatter supplies `kind` and `appetite` unless the invocation
  overrides them. A bare `{slug}` naming an existing `issues/{slug}.md` resolves the same way. See
  "Promoting an issue" in Step 4.
- `fix` / `bug` / `refactor` → set `kind`; otherwise infer from the wording, defaulting to `feature`.
- `appetite small` / `appetite big` → set appetite; else default `small` for `kind: fix`, `big` for
  `feature`/`refactor`. Those two values are the whole vocabulary; a seed whose frontmatter still
  reads `medium` rounds to `big`, because rounding up costs a research fan-out and rounding down
  fails `uvm-review`'s scope check against a contract a human already accepted.
- Everything else → the inline feature description (the seed prompt). Alongside a path it is not the
  seed: prose accompanying a promoted issue is shaping input for that seed, never an automatic scope
  extension. Check it against the injected *Open issues* list — a remark owned by a different seed is
  recorded there and named as a non-goal here (Step 4), and where it is unclear which seed owns it,
  ask. Merging two cycles is an appetite decision, not a parsing one.
- No arguments **and** no untracked `spec/*/GOAL.md` present → STOP and ask for a description or a
  GOAL.md path.

## Safety Principles

- **On `main`, otherwise-clean tree.** If the injected branch is not `main`, STOP — do not auto-switch
  or stash. The tree must be clean **except** the untracked `spec/{slug}/GOAL.md` you are adopting
  when a path was given; any *other* modified or untracked file → STOP.
- **Never overwrite a tracked GOAL.** If `spec/{slug}/` already exists **in git**, or the target branch
  already exists, STOP and report a collision. Adopting an *untracked* hand-written
  `spec/{slug}/GOAL.md` at an explicit path is the intended flow, not a collision.
- **Branch mapping:** `kind: fix` → `fix/{slug}`; `kind: feature|refactor` → `feature/{slug}`.
- **Never guess.** On any ambiguity in scope or requirements, emit a literal
  `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` marker in GOAL.md and ask the human. Record answers in the Clarifications
  section. Do not invent behavior.
- **Shaping only.** No research fan-out, no broad code exploration, no implementation. If you feel the
  urge to research, that is `/uvm-plan`'s job.
- **Size circuit-breaker (soft).** If shaping produces more than roughly 8–10 acceptance criteria, or
  several distinct deliverables, the appetite is probably too big — pause and offer the human a pilot
  plus follow-ups split, recording the deferred scope in Non-goals. A prompt, not a hard limit.
- **Bias toward the smallest surface.** This is one 850-line script that a site operator has to read
  in a sitting. A new subcommand, environment variable, or fallback costs more than its
  implementation. Before shaping something additive, check `README.md` § *Design notes* — it is the
  record of what was already considered and rejected. If the GOAL is re-proposing one of those, say so
  and make the human confirm.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Pre-flight
1. Confirm on `main` with an otherwise-clean tree. The **only** permitted pending change is the
   untracked `spec/{slug}/GOAL.md` being adopted in the path-given flow. Any other dirty or untracked
   file → STOP (commit, stash, or discard first).
2. `git fetch origin || true`; if `main` is behind, note it. Not fatal.

### Step 2 — Resolve slug, kind, appetite
1. If a `spec/<slug>/GOAL.md` path was given, use it. Otherwise derive a concise kebab `{slug}` of
   about five words or fewer from the description; if it is not obviously good, propose it and
   confirm.
2. Resolve `kind` and `appetite` per Argument Parsing.
3. Check collisions: `git rev-parse --verify {branch}` must fail (branch absent), and `spec/{slug}/`
   must not be tracked. STOP on collision.

### Step 3 — Create the branch
`git switch -c {branch} main`, where `{branch}` is `fix/{slug}` or `feature/{slug}`.

### Step 4 — Write / refine `spec/{slug}/GOAL.md`
Start from the template. Fill **Problem** (the raw need — motivate, do not design), **Outcome**,
**Acceptance criteria** as R-IDs (`R1`, `R2`, …) nudged toward EARS, **Non-goals**, **Clarifications**
(with any `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers resolved), and **Related materials**. Record `slug`, `kind`
and `appetite` in the header.

Every criterion declares how it is checked. The default is a sandbox drive under
`.agents/factory/bin/temp_root.sh` — an exit status, a path, a symlink target, a line on stderr, an
environment variable in the child process. One a drive cannot reach names its substitute in the
criterion itself: the command that stands in for the drive, the reviewer who grades it and against
what, or a real cluster, which tells the reviewer it is taken on trust rather than leaving it to
assume the criterion was checked.

**A non-goal that defers work by naming another file is a promise, and the promise is only real in
that file.** "No committed regression test — `issues/test-harness.md` owns the runner" is what lets
the cycle ship without the work, and `spec/{slug}/GOAL.md` is a dated record the named cycle never
opens. Land the obligation in that seed — an acceptance criterion, not a sentence in this GOAL — in
the same commit, or do not write the non-goal that way. `/uvm-roadmap` deletes the seed when the
cycle lands, and a promise recorded only in `GOAL.md` goes with it; Step 3 there is the backstop,
not the control.

If adopting a hand-written GOAL.md, refine it **in place**: preserve the author's intent, and only
disambiguate, structure, and add R-IDs, appetite and non-goals. Do not expand scope.

**For `kind: fix`, phrase criteria as the observable broken→fixed behavior the user sees** — never the
suspected cause or mechanism, which is unverified until `/uvm-plan` root-causes it. A criterion pinned
to a wrong diagnosis has to be reinterpreted mid-lifecycle. A WHEN clause naming the state that
triggers the behavior is not a diagnosis, and neither is a *Checked by* clause whose gate constructs
that state. Where a cycle is promoted from a landed `REVIEW.md` that already measured the mechanism,
the gate is where the measurement belongs — the criterion still reads as behavior.

**Promoting an issue.** A deferral recorded earlier arrives pre-shaped — Problem, why it was deferred,
draft R-IDs — and its body mirrors this template, so promotion is a move-and-fill. It is still a
*candidate*: **do not copy it into `GOAL.md` verbatim.** Read its `status:` first.

- **`unshaped`** — nobody has agreed an appetite, non-goals, or a final contract. That negotiation is
  this step's job, and skipping it hands `uvm-review` a contract no human ever accepted. Carry the
  evidence (`bin/uv-manager:NNN`, the mechanism, whether the defect is **pre-existing**) into
  **Problem**, and treat the draft R-IDs as input, not as the contract.
- **`shaped`** — the shaping conversation already happened with a human. Do **not** re-litigate it.
  Re-confirm the scope still holds against current `main`, cite anything that has drifted since it was
  written, surface that for sign-off, and adopt it largely as written. What this step performs is
  *acceptance into a cycle*. `shaped` does not mean fully settled: a seed may name decisions it
  deliberately parked for promotion, and settling those with the human is this step's job.
  Re-litigation is reopening what the seed decided, not answering what it left open.
- **`adopted:{other-slug}`** — already promoted. STOP and report the collision. If
  `git ls-tree main -- spec/{other-slug}` is empty and no branch carries it, the adoption is stale from
  an abandoned cycle rather than a real collision: show the human and offer to reset the status instead.
- **`declined` / `accepted-behaviour`** — terminal records, not candidates. STOP and show the human
  the recorded reasoning before doing anything.

Read the seed's `ROADMAP.md` entry too. The two halves of a deferral hold different information: the
issue holds the evidence, the entry holds the position and the reasoning for that position. An entry
recording a sequencing dependency — "after the test harness, so the fix lands with a regression test"
— is a decision a human made, and promoting out of order overrides it.
`git ls-tree main --name-only spec/` shows which cycles have landed; if the named ones have not,
surface the reordering for sign-off before shaping, and record what was decided as a Clarification and
a Non-goal.

When the GOAL lands, leave the `issues/` file in place, set its `status:` to `adopted:{slug}`, and
update that seed's `ROADMAP.md` entry in the same commit. The seed stays accurate until the branch
actually lands, so a cycle that bounces at review or is abandoned still has the evidence that
justified it; `/uvm-roadmap` retires both once the work reaches `main`. The roadmap entry has two
halves — extend its **Seed:** line with the adoption marker, and rewrite the entry body to the scope
shaping settled, since an entry still posing the question the human just answered sends the next
reader to a stale index:

    **Seed:** [`issues/{slug}.md`](issues/{slug}.md) · `{kind}` · appetite {appetite} ·
    **adopted** as [`spec/{slug}/`](spec/{slug}/GOAL.md)

Commit both edits alongside the GOAL.

An issue promoted out of `.security/issues/` keeps its evidence in the hidden lane: the public
`GOAL.md` states the **observable hardening outcome** and points at `.security/` for detail. It never
republishes an attack mechanism for a weakness that is still live.

### Step 5 — Coherence self-check
Re-read the GOAL. Is it solved, bounded to the appetite, and free of unresolved markers? Is every
requirement testable and observable? If not, iterate with the human before committing.

Then run every *Checked by* clause that is a literal command against the current tree and record what
it returned. A clause that cannot pass, or that passes before the work is done, is not a criterion —
and it will be transcribed into a `verify:` that walks `--record-attempt` toward the circuit breaker
while the code is correct. This is `/uvm-plan` Step 6's discipline one stage earlier, where these
commands are first written and cheapest to test.

### Step 6 — Meta-note (self-improvement loop · silence by default)
Before committing, reflect on the **skillset itself** — not the task, not the code. Write nothing
unless the bar is met.

**The bar (one test):** *was this the skill's fault — not mine, not the task's?* **Qualifies:** you
hand-fixed a command this skill gave (wrong flag or path, unquoted YAML); a genuinely ambiguous
instruction; a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` better guidance could have pre-empted; an allowed-tools/step
mismatch; a gate that passed or failed misleadingly. **Stay silent for:** a merely hard task; your own
error against clear guidance; a one-off content or code issue (that goes in `GOAL.md`, not here); a
vague preference.

If, and only if, the bar is met, record it in `spec/{slug}/META.md` — create it from
[`templates/META.md`](../../factory/templates/META.md) if absent, else append. You may also add a
one-line **What worked well** note when part of this skill materially helped. Caps: **at most three
findings**, terse; if an equivalent finding already exists, append "· seen again" rather than
duplicating; a fix that would weaken a non-negotiable gate (`lint.sh`, the sandbox drive, an
`invariants.md` item) is `severity=high` and must say so. **Records only** — `/uvm-harness` applies
fixes later, human-reviewed. Use the next unused `F#`, always write `status=open`, and append the
finding as a section **outside** any code fence:

```markdown
## F<n> — <one-line title>
`origin=uvm-feature:<step> severity=<high|medium|low> category=<instruction|steering|tooling|template|missing-guidance> status=open target=<best-guess file>`
- **What happened:** <what the skill made you do, or fail to do>.
- **Skill cause:** <why it's the instructions' fault — not yours, not the task's>.
- **Recommended fix:** <the change to the skill/template/script>.
- **Confidence:** <high|med|low> · **Effort:** <small|medium|large>
```

`uvm-feature` is shaping-only, so findings here are usually about ambiguous shaping guidance or the
`GOAL.md` template.

### Step 7 — Commit
```
git add spec/{slug}/GOAL.md          # add spec/{slug}/META.md too if you recorded a meta-note
git add issues/{slug}.md ROADMAP.md  # only when promoting: the two Step 4 edits
git add issues/{other-slug}.md       # a sibling seed this GOAL wrote into
git commit -m "[{category}] Shape {slug} goal"
```
`{category}` is the `AGENTS.md` commit category matching the work — normally `{kind}` itself
(`fix`|`feature`|`refactor`), or a more specific category such as `docs` when the GOAL is really that
kind of change. Never collapse everything non-`fix` to `feature`. Keep the `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
Do not push.

### Step 8 — Report & hand off
Report the branch, slug, kind, appetite, the R-ID list, and any open clarifications. Tell the human
the sign-off gate: review `spec/{slug}/GOAL.md`, then run **`/uvm-plan`**. Stop.

## Examples

- `/uvm-feature make the trampolines honor UVM_PLATFORM` — infer `feature`, derive slug
  `trampoline-platform-override`, create the branch, shape the GOAL.
- `/uvm-feature issues/test-harness.md` — promote the recorded deferral: shape its draft R-IDs into a
  contract, then flip the issue to `status: adopted:{slug}`.
- `/uvm-feature fix the provisioning lock is not released when the node is preempted` — `kind: fix`,
  appetite small, branch `fix/{slug}`.
- `/uvm-feature spec/doctor-record-check/GOAL.md` — adopt the hand-written GOAL and refine in place.

## Notes

- This skill never researches, edits the script, or pushes. That is `/uvm-plan`, `/uvm-build`,
  `/uvm-publish`.
- If a requirement cannot be made unambiguous with the human right now, leave the
  `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` marker in place and STOP — an ambiguous GOAL blocks `/uvm-plan`.
- Some `git` mutations may prompt for permission depending on your `settings.local.json`. That is
  expected and safe.
