# uvm-roadmap — retire what shipped, keep the index true

## When to Use

Invoke `/uvm-roadmap` between releases, or any time `ROADMAP.md` has stopped describing the work that
is actually left. Its main job is the one step the lifecycle never had: a cycle seeded from an
`issues/{slug}.md` ships, and nothing retires the seed, so the backlog keeps advertising work that is
already on `main`.

This is **maintenance, not a lifecycle step.** It does not touch `bin/uv-manager`, does not read or
write `GOAL/PLAN/TECH/REVIEW`, and never advances an FSM. It edits `ROADMAP.md`, deletes seeds under
`issues/`, and — in the security lane only — moves an entry rather than deleting anything.

Deliberately **not** part of `/uvm-publish`. Retirement writes outside `spec/`, which is the one thing
publish's staleness gate is built to notice; folding it in would mean excluding `issues/` from that
gate, and `/uvm-review` legitimately grades `issues/` content. Publish reports an un-retired seed and
stops there.

Reference: [`methodology.md`](../../factory/methodology.md),
[`templates/ISSUE.md`](../../factory/templates/ISSUE.md) (the `status:` vocabulary), and `AGENTS.md`
§ *Where a deferral goes*.

**Harness portability.** Runs on any harness — see [`portability.md`](../../factory/portability.md).
Run the *Current state* commands yourself if not auto-injected; ask in plain text and STOP if
`AskUserQuestion` is unavailable.

## User Instructions

Additional instructions provided with the invocation: $ARGUMENTS

## Current state (injected at load)

- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Tree: !`git status --porcelain | head -n 20`
- Adopted seeds: !`grep -rl "^status: adopted:" issues .security/issues 2>/dev/null || true`
- Queued entries: !`grep -c "^### " ROADMAP.md 2>/dev/null || true`

## Argument Parsing

- No argument → consider every adopted seed whose cycle has landed. The default.
- `<slug>` → restrict to the seed adopted by that cycle.
- `--all` → widen Step 5's drift sweep to seeds this retirement does not otherwise touch.
- `--dry-run` → run Steps 1–4 and present the preview, then STOP. No edits, no deletions, no commit.
- `status` / `report` → list adopted seeds with landed/in-flight/stale for each; no work.

## Safety Principles

- **Deleting a seed destroys the only copy outside git history.** Preview every retirement and confirm
  with the human before acting. Never delete on inference alone.
- **`del`, not `rm`.** `rm` is blocked in this environment and `del` is reversible trash. The seed is
  tracked, so follow with `git add -A` to stage the deletion; that is why this skill does not need
  `git rm`.
- **Landed means on `main`.** A seed is retired only when `git ls-tree main -- spec/{slug}` is
  non-empty. An `adopted:{slug}` marker proves a cycle *started*, never that it finished — a branch
  that bounced at review or was abandoned still carries the marker, and retiring its seed deletes the
  justification for work nobody did.
- **Never delete anything under `.security/`.** That lane is gitignored, so a deletion there leaves no
  commit and no history: the file is simply gone, and the closed finding is exactly what a later audit
  asks for. Retire it by moving its `.security/ROADMAP.md` entry to that file's terminal records, and
  keep the `.security/issues/` file. Never `git add` a path under `.security/`, and never name one in
  a commit message.
- **A GOAL is negotiated down from a seed.** Anything the cycle cut and still wants must survive
  retirement. Step 3 checks this against `GOAL.md` § *Non-goals*; it is the one failure here that
  loses work rather than leaving litter.
- **Never edit `spec/{slug}/`.** It is a dated record of what was true when written. A retired seed
  leaves a dangling `Seed:` link in `GOAL.md` § *Related materials*, and that link stays: it is the
  signpost that makes `git log --diff-filter=D -- issues/{slug}.md` a two-step recovery instead of
  archaeology. The one exception is `META.md`, the harness feedback log rather than part of the design
  record; Step 7 says when.
- **One commit per retirement**, `[harness]` category, keeping the `Co-Authored-By` trailer. Never
  push.

## Procedure

### Step 0 — status / dry-run (when requested)
`status`: classify each adopted seed and report; no work. `--dry-run`: Steps 1–4, present the preview,
STOP.

### Step 1 — Pre-flight
Clean tree; non-empty → STOP. Confirm you are on `main`; this skill does not run on a feature branch,
because a seed retired on a branch that never merges takes the backlog entry with it.

One exception, because the alternative is circular: when the tree is dirty *only* with the repair that
made this skill loadable, commit that as its own `[harness]` commit and continue. The STOP is there to
keep a retirement from being tangled with unrelated work; a fix to the factory is not unrelated work,
it is the reason the sweep can run at all. Anything else in the tree still STOPs, and the repair is
never folded into a retirement commit.

### Step 2 — Find the adopted seeds and classify each
```
grep -rl "^status: adopted:" issues .security/issues 2>/dev/null || true
```
Plain `grep`, not `git grep`: `.security/` is gitignored, and `git grep` searches tracked files only,
so it would skip that lane while appearing to work. The `|| true` is load-bearing — with `.security/`
absent `grep` exits 2 while still printing its matches, so anything branching on the exit status reads
"no adopted seeds" off a list of them. Match on the frontmatter, never on the filename — nothing
constrains a seed's filename and its cycle slug to agree, because `/uvm-feature` derives the slug in
the shaping conversation rather than copying it off the file it promotes. A filename guess deletes
nothing, or deletes the wrong thing.

Read the `{slug}` out of each `status: adopted:{slug}` value and classify:

| `git ls-tree main -- spec/{slug}` | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| non-empty | the cycle landed | retire (Steps 3–4) |
| empty, branch exists | in flight | leave alone |
| empty, no branch | abandoned; the marker is stale | offer to reset `status:` to `shaped` or `unshaped`, never delete |

The stale case matters because `/uvm-feature` STOPs on `adopted:{other-slug}` as a collision. Left
alone, an abandoned cycle permanently bricks its own seed: it can never be promoted and its ROADMAP
entry can never be worked.

### Step 3 — Check the seed shipped whole
Read `spec/{slug}/GOAL.md` § *Non-goals* against the seed's problem statement and its sketch of the
acceptance criteria. Non-goals are the written record of what the promotion negotiated away.

Anything cut and still wanted does not die with the seed. Either rewrite the seed down to the
remainder and reset `status:` to `unshaped`, re-wording its ROADMAP entry to match, or file a fresh
seed for it. Only a seed with no live remainder is deleted.

**A non-goal that discharges itself by pointing elsewhere is conditional, and the condition is what
you verify.** "Record it there", "the harness cycle must cover this", "that is a seed for `issues/`" —
each of those is the reason the cycle was allowed to ship without the work. Open the file it names and
confirm the obligation is *in* it. An intention stated in `GOAL.md`, in `PLAN.md`, or in the ROADMAP
entry is not the record; the named destination is. Where it is missing, put it there first, in the
retirement's own commit.

Check this before deleting, not after. The obligation is frequently written in exactly one place — the
roadmap entry the retirement removes — so the deletion is what makes the loss irreversible, and this
is the one failure in the sweep that costs work rather than leaving litter.

### Step 4 — Preview, confirm, retire
Present per seed: the file to delete, the ROADMAP entry to remove, any remainder being preserved, and
the cross-references Step 5 will repair. Confirm with `AskUserQuestion`.

Then, for each confirmed public-lane seed:
```
del issues/{seed}.md
```
Remove its `### ` block from `ROADMAP.md`. Security-lane seeds are moved, not deleted, per the safety
rule above.

### Step 5 — Repair what the removal broke
Find the references; do not recall them. Both strings matter, and Step 2 already says they need not be
the same:

```
grep -rn '{seed-filename}\|{slug}' --include='*.md' --include='*.lua' --include='*.sh' . \
    | grep -v '^\./\.git/'
```

Triage every hit by where it lands, because two of these destinations are deliberately left alone:

| Where the hit is | Action |
|---|---|
| `ROADMAP.md`, other `issues/*.md` | Repair. This is the work described below. |
| `.agents/` skills, templates, factory docs | Repair. An example citing a file this sweep deletes is drift; one asserting something the promotion never did is a wrong instruction. |
| `spec/**` | **Leave.** Never edit `spec/{slug}/`. The dangling `Seed:` link is the signpost that makes recovery two steps instead of archaeology. |
| `.agents/factory/harness-log.md` | **Leave.** A dated record of what was decided, not an index of what exists. |

Entries carry no numbers, so removing one renumbers nothing. What still breaks is prose:

- A cross-reference to the retired cycle by name (`Follows the rename`, `the same line as …`). The
  dependency is discharged, so say so rather than deleting the sentence — a reader needs to know the
  ordering constraint existed and cleared.
- A count (`Highest-value cycle of the three`, `Three are already queued`) that the retirement makes
  wrong, in `ROADMAP.md` and inside surviving seeds.
- A figure the shipped cycle falsified — a count, a line citation, a quoted output — anywhere in a
  file this retirement already edits. Read those whole: a stale figure standing beside a freshly
  repaired link is worse than one in a file nobody opened, because the repair is what tells a later
  reader the file was reviewed.
- With `--all`: the same figures in seeds this retirement never touches — a line count, an occurrence
  table, a file inventory. A stale baseline in a seed whose own acceptance criterion is a line-count
  guard is the one number in it that has to be right.

Reach for `--all` rather than waiting to be asked. `git diff --stat {merge-base}..main -- bin/uv-manager`
is cheap and already to hand; when the landed cycle moved the file materially, recommend it in the
Step 4 preview and say why. Citations rot wherever the shipped cycle moved code, and file overlap with
this retirement is uncorrelated with where they rotted — the seeds this sweep never opens are exactly
the ones carrying stale line numbers.

Do not rewrite a `Found by:` line. Those ordinals are provenance, not queue position.

### Step 6 — Commit
```
git add -A
git commit -m "[harness] Retire the {slug} seed and its roadmap entry"
```
One commit per retirement; fold Step 5's repairs into the commit that caused them. Keep the
`Co-Authored-By` trailer. Do not push.

### Step 7 — Report
Seeds retired, seeds left in flight, stale markers found and what was done about them, remainders
preserved, and cross-references repaired. Name anything you chose not to touch.

Name any **harness friction** this sweep exposed and offer to record it, on the same rule
`/uvm-release` Step 10 carries: `/uvm-harness` reads only `spec/*/META.md`, so on the human's OK it
goes to the retired cycle's `spec/{slug}/META.md` with `origin=uvm-roadmap:<step>` and `status=open`,
as its own `[harness]` commit.

## Examples

- `/uvm-roadmap` — retire every landed seed, one commit each.
- `/uvm-roadmap --dry-run` — preview the whole sweep; change nothing.
- `/uvm-roadmap uvm-env-prefix` — retire just that cycle's seed.
- `/uvm-roadmap status` — classify every adopted seed; no work.

## Notes

- `/uvm-publish` detects an un-retired seed and names it in its final report. It does not act: this
  skill is where deletion lives, so publish keeps neither an `Edit` tool nor a deletion verb.
- A seed that shipped leaves no terminal record. `ROADMAP.md` § *Terminal records* is for deferrals
  closed **without** shipping, where nothing else in the repository shows the question was asked. For
  shipped work the refutation is free: someone re-filing it greps the code and finds it already done.
- This skill never touches `bin/uv-manager`, never advances an FSM, and never tags a release.
