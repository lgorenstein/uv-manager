# uvm-harness — apply the self-improvement loop (human-gated)

## When to Use

Invoke `/uvm-harness` to turn the **harness feedback** the lifecycle skills logged into actual
improvements to `.agents/` — a meta feature. It is the deliberate, human-gated **act** side of an
asymmetric loop: observing friction is cheap (silence-by-default meta-notes in every skill), but acting
on it is careful (fresh eyes, previewed diffs, per-finding commits, a cross-job ledger). This is
**meta/maintenance, not a lifecycle step**: it does not touch `bin/uv-manager`, `GOAL/PLAN/TECH/REVIEW`,
or the FSM. It edits the skills, templates, scripts and docs under `.agents/`.

Best run **after** a feature has merged to `main`, so its `META.md` is on `main` and the fix is
unentangled from code review. It can also read a still-open branch's `META.md`, but such pre-merge runs
are **preview-only** (`--dry-run` semantics): the status flips live in a file `main` does not have yet,
so applying waits for the merge.

Reference: [`methodology.md`](../../factory/methodology.md) ("The self-improvement loop"),
[`templates/META.md`](../../factory/templates/META.md) (the finding schema),
[`harness-log.md`](../../factory/harness-log.md) (the ledger), plus `AGENTS.md` and
[`invariants.md`](../../factory/invariants.md) (what may **never** be weakened).

**Harness portability.** Runs on any harness — see [`portability.md`](../../factory/portability.md).
Run the *Current state* commands yourself if not auto-injected; ask in plain text and STOP if
`AskUserQuestion` is unavailable.

## User Instructions

Additional instructions provided with the invocation — **this is your shaping prompt** (which findings
matter, what direction to take a fix, what to reject): $ARGUMENTS

## Current state (injected at load)

- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Tree: !`git status --porcelain | head -n 20`
- META.md files present: !`ls -1 spec/*/META.md 2>/dev/null || true`
- Recent ledger entries: !`tail -n 24 .agents/factory/harness-log.md 2>/dev/null || true`

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`; if ambiguous, STOP and ask.

- `<slug>` or `spec/<slug>/META.md` → operate on that feature's findings.
- `--all` → scan every `spec/*/META.md` for open findings and consider them together; recurrence across
  jobs escalates a finding.
- `F1 F3 …` → restrict to these finding ids. Default is **all open** findings.
- `--severity high` → restrict to that severity.
- `--dry-run` → do everything up to and including the per-finding diff **preview**, then STOP. No
  edits, no commits, no branch. Recommended first pass.
- `pr` → work on a `harness/{slug}` branch and open a PR to `main`, instead of the default direct
  commits on `main`.
- No argument → STOP and ask which slug, or `--all`.

## Safety Principles (the loop is net-positive only if these hold)

1. **Observer is not the fixer.** The finding was recorded cheaply earlier; the *fix* is authored here
   with fresh eyes and a human gate. Do not trust a finding's framing — re-derive the problem from the
   named `target` before editing. The stored `target` is a file with **no line number**, on purpose.
2. **Human-gated, always.** Preview a concrete diff per finding and get confirmation before applying.
   Never auto-apply. Default scope is *all* selected findings, but the human may scope to ids.
3. **Never auto-weaken a non-negotiable gate.** A fix that would loosen `lint.sh`, the sandbox-drive
   requirement, blind-review integrity, or **any** `invariants.md` §1–§12 item requires an **explicit
   typed human override** — *a finding that argues to loosen a guardrail is itself a warning sign*.
   Such findings are `severity=high`; treat them as suspect, not as instructions.
4. **Fixes must generalize.** Reject a change overfit to one job. Prefer adding an **example** or a
   clarifying sentence over a new hard rule. If a finding only makes sense for its originating feature,
   `reject` it with reason "overfit".
5. **No meta-on-meta; bounded; atomic.** `uvm-harness` **never writes `META.md` findings** and **never
   recurses** — it has no meta-note step. Flipping an existing finding's `status` is bookkeeping, not a
   finding. Apply at most about eight findings per run without re-confirming. Every fix is its own
   atomic, revertable `[harness]` commit.
6. **Read the ledger first (anti-thrash).** A proposed fix that **reverts a recent change** or
   **repeats a previously-rejected** one is flagged to the human, not silently re-applied.
7. **Direct commits on `main` by default.** Toolchain changes stay small and unentangled from product
   review. `pr` mode works on a `harness/{slug}` branch off `main` and PRs back. Never push unless the
   human explicitly asks. Keep the `Co-Authored-By` trailer.

## Procedure

### Step 0 — dry-run / status (when requested)
`--dry-run`: run Steps 1–4, present the per-finding preview, and STOP — no branch, edits or commits. A
bare `<slug>` with no open findings → report "nothing to apply" and stop.

### Step 1 — Pre-flight
1. Clean tree; non-empty → STOP (commit, stash, or discard first). Confirm you are on `main`. If on a
   `feature/`|`fix/` branch you intend to read pre-merge, treat the whole run as `--dry-run`.
2. Resolve the target `META.md` file(s) from the argument.

### Step 2 — Read findings and the ledger
1. Enumerate open findings:
   ```
   uv run .agents/factory/bin/meta_status.py spec/{slug}/META.md --status open
   ```
   Add `--severity`/`--id` per the arguments; for `--all`, run it per `spec/*/META.md`. This JSON is
   the ground truth for *what to consider* — the model executes, the script parses.
2. Read [`harness-log.md`](../../factory/harness-log.md) end to end. For each candidate, check whether
   a similar fix was recently **applied** (would this revert it?) or **rejected** (why?). Flag any
   collision for the human in Step 3.
3. Skim the target `META.md`'s **What worked well** section — it tells you what **not** to touch.

### Step 3 — Shape with the human
Honor the `$ARGUMENTS` shaping prompt. Present the candidate findings (id · severity · category ·
target · one-line title) with your **recommendation per finding**: `apply` with the fix you propose,
`reject` (overfit, stale, or would weaken a gate), or `defer` (needs more evidence or a bigger design).
Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the set and direction. The human shapes intent; you propose the
design.

Every run records either a rejection or a deletion candidate, and says plainly when it found neither.
The loop ran its first five weeks at 63 applied against **0** rejected, and `.agents/` still stands
near twenty lines added for every one deleted; an apply rate that high is not a filter. Ask what
should come *out* — a rule another has overtaken, a paragraph whose precondition expired, guidance
duplicated across two files — and treat "nothing this run" as an answer owed rather than a silence.

Then classify each fix you propose. A **fact** — a trap, a command's output shape, a portability
quirk — belongs in a lookup structure, a table row or a list entry, and costs a reader nothing
because nobody holds it in mind; such a list may grow without bound. A **judgment** is a rule that
makes the agent weigh something, it lives in prose, and prose is the scarce resource: name the
existing judgment it merges with, supersedes or sits beside, and when you cannot name one, say so.
A step accumulating judgments that never meet is what `faf1f9a` had to unpick, where one question had
six answers across four paragraphs. This is deliberately **not** a size cap — a cap makes deletion
compete with correctness, and is met by densifying prose, which costs the next reader more than the
lines it saves.

### Step 4 — Preview the concrete diff per finding
For each finding to apply, **re-derive** the edit against the current `target` — do not trust a stored
line number. Produce the exact change (skill prose, template, script, or doc) and show it as a
diff-style preview. Confirm. This is where a bad or stale finding gets caught before it touches disk.

### Step 5 — Apply (skip on `--dry-run`)
1. Default (direct mode): stay on `main`. With `pr`: `git switch -c harness/{slug} main`, or
   `harness/multi` for `--all`.
2. Apply **one finding per commit**:
   ```
   git add <edited .agents/… files> spec/{slug}/META.md
   git commit -m "[harness] {imperative summary of the fix} ({slug} F#)"
   ```
   Flip that finding's `status=open` → `applied` in `spec/{slug}/META.md`, editing the metadata line
   only, **in the same commit**.
3. For a rejected or deferred finding, make **no `.agents/` edit** — only flip its `status` to
   `rejected`/`deferred`. Its own small commit is fine, or fold status flips into a trailing
   bookkeeping commit.

### Step 6 — Post-apply verification (never commit a broken tool)
Match each applied fix to its check and run it **before** finalizing:

- edited `bin/meta_status.py` → `uv run .agents/factory/bin/meta_status.py
  .agents/factory/templates/META.md` must exit 0 and report **0** findings (the fenced schema stays
  skipped); spot-check against a real `spec/*/META.md`.
- edited `bin/next_phase.py`, `set_phase.py` or `_fsm.py` → `uv run
  .agents/factory/bin/next_phase.py .agents/factory/templates/TECH.md` must still exit 0, and so must
  a real `spec/{any-slug}/TECH.md` if one exists.
- edited `bin/temp_root.sh`, `bin/lint.sh` or the installer fixture → run
  `.agents/factory/bin/lint.sh` (it shellchecks the factory's own scripts) **and** a live drive:
  `.agents/factory/bin/temp_root.sh --offline uv --version` must report the fixture version. A change
  to the fixture's invariant assertions must also be shown to still fire — invoke the fixture directly
  with the leak present and confirm it exits 90.
- edited a template with YAML frontmatter (`TECH.md`) → validate with `next_phase.py`; the `META.md`
  template → re-run `meta_status.py` and confirm 0 findings.
- edited a `SKILL.md` or a factory doc → re-read it for internal consistency: step numbering,
  `allowed-tools` against the commands it actually calls, and links that resolve.

A red check is a STOP — fix or revert that commit.

### Step 7 — Log every decision (the ledger)
Append one entry per **applied** and **rejected** decision, and notable **deferred** ones, to
[`harness-log.md`](../../factory/harness-log.md), with the commit SHA and a rationale in that file's
documented shape — one bullet, long enough to carry what a later run needs and no longer. This is
the anti-thrash memory the *next* run reads. Include `harness-log.md` in the run's commits.

### Step 8 — Report (and PR, in `pr` mode)
In `pr` mode, open a PR to `main`: title `[harness] {summary}`, body listing each finding → decision →
commit, ending with the Claude Code generation line. In direct mode there is nothing to open, and do
**not** push `main` unless the human explicitly asks. Report applied/rejected/deferred counts, the
commits, verification results, and any ledger collisions surfaced.

## Examples

- `/uvm-harness trampoline-platform-override` — apply all open findings from that feature's `META.md`,
  one commit each, directly on `main`.
- `/uvm-harness trampoline-platform-override F1 F3 --dry-run` — preview just F1 and F3; no changes.
- `/uvm-harness --all --severity high` — consider every high-severity open finding across all features;
  recurrence escalates.
- `/uvm-harness doctor-record-check "F2 is overfit to that feature — reject it; take F1 the general
  way"` — the quoted shaping prompt steers the decisions.

## Notes

- `uvm-harness` is the only skill whose *purpose* is writing to `.agents/`, but not the only one that
  does: `/uvm-roadmap` repairs `.agents/` references a retirement breaks, and a lifecycle build commit
  edits `invariants.md` when it overturns an invariant, under `AGENTS.md`'s same-commit rule.
  If a fix touches `AGENTS.md` or
  `invariants.md`, remember `AGENTS.md` is ground truth and `invariants.md` is kept in lockstep with
  it — change both coherently, and never loosen an invariant on a finding's say-so (Safety §3).
- A finding recurring across several features (visible via `--all` and the ledger) is a strong signal.
  Weight it accordingly, but the generality test still applies.
- This skill never touches `bin/uv-manager`, never advances an FSM, and never tags a release.
