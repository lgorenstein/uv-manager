# The uv-manager software factory — methodology

The reference an agent reads when it needs to understand the spec-driven lifecycle the `uvm-*` skills
implement. The skills themselves are thin; this is the *why*. When something here disagrees with a
skill, **the skill body is the operating procedure** — fix this file.

## Why a factory for one shell script

The obvious objection is that 850 lines of bash does not need a five-stage lifecycle, and for a
one-line change it does not — ceremony scales to appetite, and that is a rule, not an apology. The
factory earns its place for a different reason: this script is deployed centrally at national
computing centers, its failure modes are silent and expensive, and it has no test suite yet. Process
is standing in for coverage. A blind reviewer who must cite an executed command is the closest thing
to CI this repository currently has.

That is also the honest reading of the artifacts. `spec/{slug}/` is not bureaucracy — it is the
record of what was intended, what was rejected, and what was actually run, for a change nobody can
re-derive from a 40-character diff six months later.

## The lifecycle

One feature (or fix/refactor) flows through five lifecycle skills, on its own branch, with every
artifact committed under `spec/{slug}/`:

```
main ──/uvm-feature──▶ feature|fix/{slug}     GOAL.md            (shape: what & why, locked)
          │
          ├──────────/uvm-plan──────────▶     research/ PLAN.md TECH.md   (design + phased FSM)
          │
          ├──────────/uvm-build─────────▶     bin/uv-manager + docs       (execute one phase)
          │            ▲        │
          │            └────────┘  (loop until TECH.md is done)
          │
          ├──────────/uvm-review────────▶     REVIEW.md          (adversarial QA, clean context)
          │            │
          │      changes-requested ──▶ back to /uvm-build ;  approved ──▶
          │
          └──────────/uvm-publish───────▶     PR → main   (default)  |  local squash-merge
```

The artifact spine — **`GOAL.md → PLAN.md → TECH.md`** — is the standard spec-driven skeleton (Spec
Kit's `spec→plan→tasks`, Kiro's `requirements→design→tasks`). These are committed as an immutable,
dated design record, not as a living source of truth that must be maintained forever. **The script and
`AGENTS.md` remain ground truth; `spec/{slug}/` is a point-in-time record of intent.**

Three operational skills sit outside the lifecycle. **`/uvm-harness`** applies the factory's own
self-improvement findings back to `.agents/`. **`/uvm-roadmap`** retires the seeds whose cycles have
landed and repairs the drift that leaves in `ROADMAP.md`. **`/uvm-release`** bumps the single version
source and cuts a signed, tagged release. None touches the FSM or product requirements. `/uvm-roadmap`
and `/uvm-release` may append a finding to an existing `spec/{slug}/META.md` and nothing more;
`/uvm-harness` writes none, which is what keeps the loop from recursing.

**A contract can move mid-cycle, and that has a route.** The lifecycle assumes `GOAL.md` is settled
before `/uvm-build` starts, and twice on one cycle a build found a defect that belonged in the
contract. No skill owns it: `/uvm-feature` STOPs off `main`, `/uvm-build` only escalates,
`/uvm-review` is not running. The amendment is a maintainer-gated commit on the cycle's own branch
carrying the whole artifact set at once — the R-ID, its Clarification, the `PLAN.md` design and table
rows, the invariant-gate note, any new phase — with a subject naming it an amendment. It states which
soft circuit-breakers it crosses, and where it overturns an invariant rather than adding one, the
`AGENTS.md` sign-off that decision needs is this commit itself.

## Load-bearing principles

1. **`AGENTS.md` is the constitution.** There is no separate `constitution.md`; the skills reference
   `AGENTS.md` and the curated [`invariants.md`](invariants.md). The `uvm-plan` invariant gate and the
   `uvm-review` footgun checklist both draw from it.
2. **Files and git are the durable substrate.** State lives only in the committed `TECH.md`
   frontmatter, re-read fresh each invocation. Never rely on conversation memory to carry lifecycle
   state — `uvm-review` runs in a separate context and `uvm-build` may run days later on another
   machine.
3. **Parallelism for research, never for building.** `uvm-plan` fans out read-only research subagents.
   `uvm-build` is strictly single-threaded and linear. This matters more here than in a multi-module
   project: there is one file, so two builders are two agents editing the same 850 lines.
4. **Blind, externally-verified review beats self-review.** The reviewer is denied the author's
   PLAN/TECH rationale and must cite executed commands. Enforced by spawning a fresh subagent, not by
   trusting a human to `/clear`.
5. **Ceremony scales to appetite.** The dominant failure of spec-driven tooling is uniform heavyweight
   process — sixteen acceptance criteria for a one-line fix. `appetite: small` (the default for
   `fix/`) skips the research fan-out and may collapse PLAN and TECH; a one-sentence change skips the
   lifecycle entirely.
6. **Never guess.** Ambiguity gets a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` marker and a question to the human,
   recorded into `GOAL.md`. This mirrors `AGENTS.md`'s "the code is ground truth".
7. **Observe cheaply, act deliberately.** The factory improves *itself* through an asymmetric loop:
   every lifecycle skill records harness friction into `spec/{slug}/META.md` at near-zero cost (silence
   by default), but fixes are applied only by the human-gated `uvm-harness`, with fresh eyes and
   guardrails that forbid quietly weakening a gate.

## What we take from Shape Up, and what we drop

Shape Up (Singer, 2019) is a team methodology; we take its cognitive tools and drop its org rituals.

**Adopt:**

- **Appetite** — fixed budget, variable scope. Expressed as a phase cap, since calendar weeks are
  meaningless at machine tempo.
- **Shaping** — `GOAL.md` is rough, solved, and bounded: concrete enough to de-risk, abstract enough to
  leave design freedom.
- **No-gos** — explicit exclusions in `GOAL.md`. Especially valuable here, where the standing bias is
  to delete rather than add.
- **Rabbit holes** — each `research/{topic}.md` investigates one unknown that could blow the appetite.
- **Hill state** — `hill: uphill|crest|downhill` per phase encodes risk and confidence. A phase stuck
  uphill across builds is a raised hand.
- **Scope hammering** — nice-to-haves are cuttable; `uvm-review` scope-checks against the appetite.
- **Circuit breaker** — cap build iterations and review bounce-backs; on trip, stop and re-shape.

**Discard:** the betting table, the six-week cadence, cool-down, two-track pipelining, dedicated QA
roles. All exist to synchronize and shield a human team, and dissolve for a serial solo-plus-agent
pipeline.

**Quality is not negotiable here.** Shape Up assumes scope is cuttable and most bugs can wait. That is
false for this script's invariants. A wrapper that puts an `x86_64` binary on an `aarch64` node, or
hands a pinned caller a different version, or leaks a provisioning lock, fails silently inside someone
else's job. The `hammerable: false` phase flag operationalizes this: `uvm-review` must never
scope-hammer a correctness phase to fit the appetite.

issues/{slug}.md          # deferred code work, pre-shaped — /uvm-feature promotes one into a GOAL
ROADMAP.md                # the ordered index; each entry's **Seed:** points at an issues/ file
.security/                # the same two, for unremediated findings — gitignored, never published
AGENTS.md                 # the constitution (CLAUDE.md is a symlink to it)
```

**Where a deferral goes.** Work a pass decides *not* to do is not an artifact of that feature, so it
does not live in `spec/{slug}/`. It becomes an `issues/{slug}.md` — pre-shaped from
[`templates/ISSUE.md`](templates/ISSUE.md) — plus an ordered `ROADMAP.md` entry pointing at it.
`META.md` is **never** the destination: that file is harness feedback, and the boundary is stated once
in `AGENTS.md`. The `status:` field keeps a deferral a candidate: `/uvm-feature` promotes it into a
real `GOAL.md`, and that promotion is where a human negotiates appetite, non-goals and R-IDs. When the
cycle lands, `/uvm-roadmap` retires the seed and its index entry, so the backlog stops advertising work
that is already on `main`.

Security-sensitive deferrals take the hidden lane: `.security/issues/` plus `.security/ROADMAP.md`,
same convention, gitignored. A public roadmap of unremediated weaknesses is an attacker's work plan;
fixes are public when they ship, the standing inventory is not.

`.claude` is a symlink to `.agents`, so Claude Code discovers the skills and settings through it. The
skills reference bundled scripts and shared reference material by **repo-relative path**
(`.agents/factory/…`), which keeps them portable across harnesses — see
[`portability.md`](portability.md).

## Verification without a test suite

There is no test suite yet. The factory compensates in three ways, and every `verify:` command should
use at least one:

- **Static.** `bash -n bin/uv-manager` catches syntax under bash 3.2; `.agents/factory/bin/lint.sh`
  adds `shellcheck` (fetched through `uvx --from shellcheck-py`) and asserts the `bin/` symlinks are
  still symlinks.
- **Behavioral, sandboxed.** `.agents/factory/bin/temp_root.sh` runs the working tree's wrapper against
  a throwaway `UVM_ROOT` with the inherited environment scrubbed, and removes it on exit.
- **Behavioral, offline and heterogeneous.** `--offline` points `UVM_INSTALL_URL` at a `file://`
  fixture, which exercises the whole provisioning path with no egress and asserts the installer
  environment was scrubbed. `--arch <key>` sets `UVM_PLATFORM`, so one sandbox can hold several
  architectures and the heterogeneous-cluster behavior is reachable on a laptop.

A `verify:` command that only asserts exit 0 is not a gate. Assert the post-condition: a symlink
target, a path that exists, a version string, a specific line on stderr.

## The self-improvement loop (META.md + `uvm-harness`)

The five lifecycle skills improve the *product*; this loop improves the *factory*. Skill friction is
otherwise invisible and forgotten between sessions, so each lifecycle skill ends with a
silence-by-default meta-note step that appends a finding to `spec/{slug}/META.md` **only** when the
skillset itself cost something. The single gate is one test: *was this the skill's fault — not mine,
not the task's?* A merely hard task, a self-inflicted error, or a one-off code issue that belongs in
`GOAL.md` or `REVIEW.md` is not a finding.

```
uvm-feature ─┐
uvm-plan     ├─ meta-note (silence by default) ─► spec/{slug}/META.md
uvm-build    │                                          │  (kept OUT of the blind reviewer's context)
uvm-review  ─┘  (orchestrator only)                     │
                                                        ▼
uvm-publish ──► reads open findings (meta_status.py) ─► "Harness feedback" block in the PR
                                                        ▼
uvm-harness ──► human-gated: shape → preview → apply to .agents/ ─► flip status + log harness-log.md
```

The design is deliberately asymmetric — cheap to observe, deliberate to act — so it cannot become a
token sink or quietly loosen its own guardrails:

- **Producers** (`uvm-feature`/`uvm-plan`/`uvm-build`/`uvm-review`) only record, never fix, at most
  three terse findings each. `uvm-build` is the richest source, because it runs per phase across
  separate invocations and appending to a file preserves signal a context reset erases.
  `uvm-review`'s finding is written by the *orchestrator*, never by the blind reviewer, which must not
  read `META.md` at all — it leaks author intent.
- **The applier is separated from the observer.** `uvm-harness` is human-gated always and bound by
  hard guardrails: it never auto-weakens a non-negotiable gate without an explicit typed override — *a
  finding arguing to loosen a guardrail is itself a warning sign* — prefers an example over a new hard
  rule, keeps per-finding atomic revertable commits with post-apply verification, writes no `META.md`
  findings (no recursion), and reads [`harness-log.md`](harness-log.md) first so a fix that reverts a
  recent change or repeats a rejected one is flagged rather than silently re-applied.

**Observe earns act.** The cheap half should prove it produces real signal over the first few features
before the applier is leaned on hard. A finding that recurs across features (via `uvm-harness --all`
and the ledger) escalates itself. As with the FSM, the fragile parsing is owned by a script —
`meta_status.py` — not the model.

## Traceability chain

`GOAL.md` R-IDs → `PLAN.md` requirement→design map → `TECH.md` phase `satisfies:` → commits →
`REVIEW.md` requirement→evidence matrix → PR body. Because merges are squashed, the committed
`spec/{slug}/` folder *is* the retained trace.

Provenance lives in that chain, **not in source comments**. Comments explain the invariant or the
*why* on their own terms and never embed R-IDs or phase ids: those restart per feature, collide across
branches, and mean nothing to a later reader of `bin/uv-manager`. `git blame → commit → PR →
spec/{slug}/` recovers the requirement behind any line when you need it.
