# The static gate: syntax, shellcheck, and repository-shape checks that a factory
# `verify:` command can depend on. Until the project has a test suite this is the
# cheapest real signal available, so it must stay green — a gate with a known
# failure is not a gate.
#
# Usage:
#   .agents/factory/bin/lint.sh            # all checks
#   .agents/factory/bin/lint.sh --no-net   # skip shellcheck if it needs downloading
#
# The linter is preferred from PATH, and otherwise obtained through
# `uvx --from shellcheck-py shellcheck` — no system install, and the tool this
# project wraps supplies its own linter.
#
# Exit codes: 0 all checks passed · 1 a check failed · 3 a check could not be run
# (missing tool). 3 is distinct from 1 on purpose: "could not run" must never be
# mistaken for "passed".

# ---- 4. skill state injections ---------------------------------------------

# command's own output inside it, so a correct answer arrives looking like a fault.
# `grep -r` over an absent .security/issues exits 2 while still listing every match,
# and that alone made /uvm-roadmap unrunnable.
#
# The commands execute at every skill load regardless; running them here only moves
# the discovery to a developer who is watching. Empty state is the case that breaks
# them, and it is reachable only from a repository in that state, which is why this
# is a gate rather than a rule someone remembers. portability.md carries the rule.
