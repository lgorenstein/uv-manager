# META — lock-acquire-retake

Harness self-improvement notes for this cycle. Records only; `/uvm-harness` applies fixes.

## Friction findings

## F1 — the fix-criteria rule is absolute but its rationale is conditional
`origin=uvm-feature:step-4 severity=low category=instruction status=applied target=.claude/skills/uvm-feature/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** Step 4 says for `kind: fix`, phrase criteria as observable broken→fixed behavior
  "never the suspected cause or mechanism, which is unverified until `/uvm-plan` root-causes it."
  This cycle was promoted from a *completed* review that had already root-caused the defect with a
  matched A/B and shipped it in a release, so the mechanism is contract-grade evidence rather than a
  suspicion. R1 names it anyway, because a criterion phrased purely as "a rank sometimes dies" cannot
  be turned into the deterministic gate the seed already carries — the gate *is* the mechanism.
- **Skill cause:** the prohibition is written absolutely while the reason given for it holds only
  when the cause is unverified. Promotion from a landed review cycle is the standing case where it
  does not, and the skill has a whole `shaped`/`unshaped` vocabulary for exactly that provenance
  without connecting it to this rule.
- **Recommended fix:** qualify it — mechanism stays out of a criterion *while it is a hypothesis*,
  and may be named once a landed cycle's `REVIEW.md` has measured it, which is also what makes a
  red gate constructible.
- **Confidence:** med · **Effort:** small

## F2 — two Step 3 rules both claim authority over the fan-out, with no stated precedence
`origin=uvm-plan:step-3 severity=medium category=instruction status=applied target=.claude/skills/uvm-plan/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** Step 3's *high blast radius* exception mandates the full fan-out "regardless of
  appetite" for any change to `uvm_acquire_lock`. This GOAL's Clarifications resolve the opposite in
  as many words: appetite stays `small` and the collateral risk is "answered by R4 being a graded
  criterion rather than by a research fan-out". Both are binding and neither yields. Resolved by
  running a deliberately narrow three-topic fan-out, which served the work, but the choice was mine
  rather than the skill's.
- **Skill cause:** the *diagnostic* exception ends with an explicit tie-break — "when they disagree
  with the GOAL, the GOAL wins" — and the high-blast-radius exception, written immediately after it,
  has none. The omission reads as deliberate on one reading and as an oversight on the other.
- **Recommended fix:** give the high-blast-radius exception its own tie-break sentence. It should
  *not* simply defer to the GOAL — the exception exists precisely because a human may under-scope an
  edit in this region. Stating that a GOAL may narrow the fan-out's breadth but not eliminate it
  would have named what this cycle actually did.
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

## F3 — "a gate that exits 0 today is inert" has no case for a collateral criterion
`origin=uvm-plan:step-6 severity=medium category=missing-guidance status=open target=.claude/skills/uvm-plan/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** Step 6 requires every `verify:` to be run against the current tree and treats
  exit 0 there as evidence the gate is inert. R4 and R6 here are *collateral* criteria — they demand
  that behavior not change, so their drives are green before and after by construction. Following the
  rule literally would have meant discarding or contorting four correct regression gates. `P2` keeps
  them and carries a red post-condition of its own (the measurements record) so the phase still has
  one, but the skill gave no guidance for that shape.
- **Skill cause:** the rule is written for gates that assert something the phase will deliver, and a
  regression gate asserts something the phase must not destroy. Both are legitimate `verify:`
  content; only the first is described.
- **Recommended fix:** name the second shape and say what it owes — a regression gate may be green
  today, but the phase carrying it must also assert at least one post-condition that is red today, so
  the phase as a whole is still falsifiable.
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

## F4 — the debate variant gives both reviewers one scratchpad, and their fixtures collide
`origin=uvm-review:step-2 severity=high category=instruction status=applied target=.claude/skills/uvm-review/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** the two reviewers were launched with the same scratchpad path and both built a
  `mkdir` PATH shim there. One reported that the other's shim overwrote its own mid-pass and re-ran
  its whole set in an isolated subtree; the other reported HEAD failure rates its instrumented
  re-measurement could not reproduce, in a burst whose fixtures lived in that shared directory.
- **Skill cause:** Step 2 tells the orchestrator to launch two independent reviewers but says nothing
  about isolating their working state, and the harness hands every subagent the same scratchpad. The
  variant's whole claim is two independent measurements; sharing mutable fixtures between them makes
  the measurements dependent in a way neither reviewer can see from inside.
- **Recommended fix:** Step 2 must give each debate reviewer a distinct subdirectory
  (`.../scratchpad/{ship,block}/`) in its prompt, and say why — a shim, a staged baseline binary or a
  planted lock written to a shared path silently invalidates the other's drives. This weakens the
  executed-evidence spine, which is why it is `high`.
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

**What worked well:** the rule that a non-goal deferring work by naming another file is only real in
that file. Following it turned up that `issues/test-harness.md` R3d does not cover this cycle's
defect — its stated premise is that every defect in this area needs two processes racing, which this
cycle's single-process gate is the counterexample to. Without that step the non-goal would have
pointed at an obligation that did not exist.

**What worked well:** Step 6's instruction to copy the repository outside the working tree and
prove a gate can go green. Applied to the whole design rather than one gate, it turned the plan's
central question — whether `[[ -d ]]` can tell a lost race from a filesystem fault — from an argument
into six measurements before a line of the real diff was written.

**What worked well:** the debate variant earned its cost. Two reviewers returned opposite verdicts on
the same diff, which forced the orchestrator to measure the disputed claim itself rather than adopt
either account — and the measurement that settled it (a control run proving the construction reaches
the race before reading anything into a clean result) is one neither reviewer performed.
