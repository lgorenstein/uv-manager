## What worked well

- `uvm-plan` Step 6's insistence that every `verify:` be **run** before the plan is committed earned
  its keep twice in one cycle: `git grep -c`'s filename prefix and a planted `pid=1` that `kill -0`
  reads as dead both made a gate red while the code was correct. Reading them would have caught
  neither.
- `uvm-feature` Step 4's rule that a deferral naming another file is only a promise in that file is
  what produced three real seed edits here instead of three sentences in *Non-goals*. This promotion
  deferred four of the seed's six sketch criteria, and every one of them would have been deleted with
  the seed by `/uvm-roadmap`. The rule paid for itself in one run.

## Friction findings

<!-- Real findings are appended below this line by the lifecycle skills. -->

## F1 — Step 4's roadmap-rewrite rule covers the promoted seed and not the siblings a promotion edits
`origin=uvm-feature:4 severity=medium category=missing-guidance status=applied target=.agents/skills/uvm-feature/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** Step 4 specifies the adoption marker and says to "rewrite the entry body to the
  scope shaping settled" for *this* seed's `ROADMAP.md` entry. Landing the deferral obligations
  changed three sibling seeds — `invariant-audit-gaps` gained a fourth criterion, `test-harness`
  gained two, and `lock-owner-write-errno`'s sequencing premise was answered — and each has its own
  `ROADMAP.md` entry that went stale the moment the seed changed. `invariant-audit-gaps`'s entry
  heading read "Three small code gaps" against a seed now carrying four. Step 7 acknowledges sibling
  seeds exist (`git add issues/{other-slug}.md`) but nothing says their entries move too, so a run
  following the letter of Step 4 leaves the index false in exactly the places it just edited.
- **Skill cause:** The rule is written for the one-seed case. `ROADMAP.md`'s own contract is one entry
  per issue, so any edit to a seed's criteria or sequencing invalidates its entry — the promoted seed
  is not special, it is merely the one the skill was thinking about.
- **Recommended fix:** Extend Step 4's roadmap paragraph: any seed this promotion writes into gets its
  entry rewritten in the same commit, on the same terms, and Step 7's `git add issues/{other-slug}.md`
  line gains `ROADMAP.md` as its companion.
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

## F2 — Step 5's gate-rehearsal rule contradicts itself for a fix cycle
`origin=uvm-feature:5 severity=medium category=instruction status=applied target=.agents/skills/uvm-feature/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** Step 5 says to run every literal *Checked by* command against the current tree,
  then rules that "a clause that cannot pass, or that passes before the work is done, is not a
  criterion". For a `kind: fix` cycle both halves are backwards. Three of this contract's six gates
  **cannot** pass now — that is what makes them red states, and Step 4 two paragraphs earlier requires
  a fix's criteria be phrased as the broken→fixed behavior that produces exactly such a gate. One gate
  **must** pass now, because it pins unchanged behavior; `spec/lock-acquire-retake/GOAL.md` R6 is the
  same shape and shipped, annotated "green today and green after". I ran the commands and then had to
  decide the rule did not mean what it said.
- **Skill cause:** The sentence was written for a feature's forward-looking gates and applied to every
  criterion. Read literally by a run less willing to overrule it, it deletes the red states a fix cycle
  exists to establish, or the collateral gates that catch a remediation shipping damage instead of a
  repair — which is the failure `lock-acquire-retake` R4 was added to prevent.
- **Recommended fix:** Split the rule by what the criterion is for. A gate is defective when it passes
  *and* claims to show a defect, or fails *and* claims to pin existing behavior. State that a fix
  cycle's gates are expected red now and its unchanged-behavior gates green now, and require the
  observed status be written into the criterion either way, as this GOAL does.
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

## F3 — Nothing requires a research brief's recommended shell idiom to be tested before it is adopted
`origin=uvm-plan:3 severity=high category=missing-guidance status=applied target=.agents/skills/uvm-plan/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** A brief recommended the fix's central guard as `[[ "${lock}" -ot "${mark}" ]]`.
  Bash documents `-ot` as true when file1 does not exist and file2 does, so that expression passes
  **exactly when the lock is already gone** — fail-open in the one state the guard exists to catch.
  A second brief then reproduced the same form. Nothing in Step 3 or Step 4 asks for a recommended
  idiom to be run; I caught it only by testing it on my own initiative, and the corrected form
  (`[[ -d "${lock}" && … ]]`) had to be pushed back into the research round.
- **Skill cause:** Step 6 requires every `verify:` be executed before the plan is committed, which
  catches a dead *gate*. There is no equivalent for the *design* a brief recommends, even though
  Step 3 explicitly invites briefs to drive the script and they arrive carrying source. So the one
  artefact the plan copies verbatim into the highest-risk function is the one artefact no step
  requires anybody to run.
- **Recommended fix:** Add to Step 4: any shell idiom a brief recommends and the design adopts is
  executed against the portability floor first, and PLAN records what it returned. One line, and it
  is the same discipline Step 6 already applies to gates.
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

## F4 — Step 6's red-gate rule has no category for a gate blocked on an earlier phase
`origin=uvm-plan:6 severity=medium category=missing-guidance status=applied target=.agents/skills/uvm-plan/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** Step 6 sorts a red gate into two kinds — red on the asserted post-condition
  (good) or red for its own reasons (bad). Two of four phases here gate on a deliverable an earlier
  phase produces, so at plan time they died on `tests/lock-race.sh: No such file or directory`, which
  is neither. I had to decide the rule did not cover it and invent an idiom — a `test -x … || { echo
  "FAIL: P1 has not landed"; }` guard — so the failure reads as a dependency rather than a broken
  gate.
- **Skill cause:** The rule is written for a single phase in isolation, but the same step tells you to
  author phases as ordered vertical slices with `depends_on`, which makes a gate depending on an
  earlier phase's output the normal case rather than an exception.
- **Recommended fix:** Name the third category in Step 6: a gate whose first unmet clause is an
  artefact from a phase in its own `depends_on` is legitimately red, and should say so in one guarded
  line rather than dying on a raw shell error.
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

## F5 — The gate-authoring trap list omits `git grep -c`, which the same step recommends using
`origin=uvm-plan:6 severity=low category=missing-guidance status=applied target=.agents/skills/uvm-plan/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** `n=$(git grep -c flock -- bin/uv-manager); [ "$n" = 1 ]` is always false:
  `git grep -c` prints `bin/uv-manager:1`, not `1`. The gate was red while the code was correct, and
  would have walked `--record-attempt` toward the circuit breaker in a phase whose job is to prove
  nothing changed.
- **Skill cause:** Step 6 keeps a good, specific list of gate traps — `! cmd` under `set -e`, an
  interpolated pathspec under `zsh`, a prose anchor spanning a wrapped line — and `git grep` is the
  substitute it recommends by name for a documentation sweep. Its `-c` output shape belongs on that
  list; `grep -c` on a path prints the bare count and is the right spelling for a census.
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

## F6 — Step 4's "red before the fix" check is unavailable exactly when the skill tells you to retune a gate
`origin=uvm-build:P1 severity=medium category=missing-guidance status=applied target=.agents/skills/uvm-build/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** Step 4 says a new or retuned `verify:` must be confirmed "red before the fix and
  green after". I retuned P1's gate mid-phase — Step 1 prescribes `set_phase.py --verify` for exactly
  this — but by then the deliverable existed, so the pre-fix state the check wants was gone and the
  new assertion block had never been observed failing. I had to invent a substitute: feed the block a
  `--plant none` run and show it rejects on three of its five keys.
- **Skill cause:** The instruction assumes a gate is authored before the code it grades. The same
  skill prescribes retuning a gate through `set_phase.py --verify` in remediation mode and mid-phase,
  both of which happen *after* code exists, so the check is structurally unavailable in the flow the
  skill itself directs you into. Nothing offers the substitute.
- **Recommended fix:** Say what to do when the pre-fix state is gone: construct an input the new
  assertion must reject and show it rejecting, which is the same evidence in the only form still
  available. One sentence beside the existing red-before-green-after rule.
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

## F7 — `run_verify.py`'s trace escapes the gate's newlines, so a mangled gate and an intact one look alike
`origin=uvm-build:P1 severity=low category=tooling status=applied target=.agents/factory/bin/run_verify.py`
- **What happened:** The trace prints `+ /bin/sh -c 'set -eu\n.agents/factory/bin/lint.sh …'` with
  literal `\n` between every statement. That is precisely the shape of a gate whose newlines were
  lost in reflowing — the failure `run_verify.py` exists to prevent — so I had to reason from the
  gate's *behavior* to establish that the string it executed was intact.
- **Skill cause:** Step 4 mandates this tool on the grounds that hand-copying a wrapped gate is where
  a quoting error enters, then the tool renders its own input in a form indistinguishable from that
  error. A reader who trusts the trace concludes the opposite of the truth.
- **Recommended fix:** Print the gate as a real multi-line block before the `+` line, or escape
  nothing and let it wrap. Either makes a genuinely collapsed gate visibly different.
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

## F8 — Nothing tells a build phase to re-measure a researched mechanism before adopting it wholesale
`origin=uvm-build:P3 severity=medium category=missing-guidance status=applied target=.agents/skills/uvm-build/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** P3's design came from a research brief that had measured it green over 3648
  ranks. Implemented as specified it wedged 1 burst in 40 — 64 ranks timing out against a lock nobody
  held — and took two rounds of diagnosis plus out-of-tree instrumentation to correct. Step 3 says to
  execute the checklist and to check a *new shell primitive* against `invariants.md` §10, and Step 4
  says to run the phase's gate. Neither asks whether the researched mechanism still measures as it
  did once it is sitting in the real function next to the other guards.
- **Skill cause:** The skill treats `research/` as settled input and the gate as the check. That is
  right for a deterministic gate and wrong for a statistical one: a brief reporting zero over N ranks
  has a confidence interval, and a rate of 1 in 40 bursts is invisible to a run that did 40. The gate
  caught it here only because P1 had landed a progress assertion the brief itself had needed after
  its own false green — which is the same lesson arriving twice.
- **Recommended fix:** Where a phase adopts a mechanism whose evidence is a rate rather than a
  post-condition, say to re-run that measurement at the researched size *before* checking the box, and
  to treat a disagreement with the brief as a finding about the brief. One sentence in Step 3, beside
  the existing primitive check.
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

## F9 — Step 4's "prove it red" has no answer for a gate whose red state is a live filesystem race
`origin=uvm-build:P3 severity=low category=missing-guidance status=applied target=.agents/skills/uvm-build/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** P3's gate had to be shown red before the fix. The fix spans `bin/uv-manager` plus
  two documentation files whose text the same gate also asserts, so reverting everything makes the
  gate fail on prose rather than on the race. I stashed **only** `bin/uv-manager`, which isolates the
  behavioral half and leaves the prose assertions satisfied — the gate then went red on the drive, for
  the right reason, and green again on `stash pop`.
- **Skill cause:** Step 4 describes proving a gate red by copying the repo out of tree and applying
  the change. For a mixed gate that is the wrong granularity: reverting the whole phase conflates a
  behavioral assertion with a prose one, and the reader cannot tell which fired.
- **Recommended fix:** Add the partial-revert idiom — revert only the file the behavioral assertion
  grades, and name which clause you expect to fire. It is cheaper than an out-of-tree copy and it
  answers a question the copy cannot.
- **Confidence:** med · **Effort:** small

## F10 — On cycle 1 the reviewer's commit log leaks the plan's phase structure
`origin=uvm-review:step-2 severity=high category=instruction status=open target=.claude/skills/uvm-review/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** Step 2 drops the log's *subjects* only on `review.cycle` >= 1, and only because
  they name a prior cycle's findings. On cycle 1 it prescribes `git log --oneline`. This branch's
  build subjects read `[fix] Build lock-break-instance-identity P3: age, pin, verify, remove` — the
  phase ids and phase names straight out of `TECH.md`. I withheld the subjects on my own judgement;
  the skill as written would have handed the blind reviewers the plan's decomposition.
- **Skill cause:** The rule is scoped to the wrong leak. It treats prior-cycle findings as the thing
  subjects disclose, when the standing convention `AGENTS.md` sets for build commits puts `TECH.md`
  phase ids and names in every subject on every cycle, cycle 1 included.
- **Recommended fix:** Make `--format=%h` the default for all cycles, not a cycle-2+ measure, and say
  why: build subjects in this repo carry phase ids by convention. Keep "omitting the log is equally
  correct."
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

## F11 — Step 2 says to paste `GOAL.md` inline, with no sanctioned way to hand over a byte-exact copy
`origin=uvm-review:step-2 severity=medium category=instruction status=open target=.claude/skills/uvm-review/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** `GOAL.md` here is 239 lines / 18 KB, and Step 2 requires it "inline" so the
  reviewer never browses `spec/`. Retyping it into two prompts risks silently corrupting the contract
  the pass grades against. I staged a byte-exact `cp` into each reviewer's scratchpad instead.
- **Skill cause:** The instruction fixes on a mechanism (paste) rather than the property it wants
  (the contract reaches the reviewer intact; `spec/` stays unbrowsed). A scratchpad copy satisfies
  both and the skill does not mention it, so each run re-derives the workaround or transcribes.
- **Recommended fix:** Sanction staging a copy of `GOAL.md` into the reviewer's scratchpad as the
  preferred hand-off, with pasting as the fallback. Note it is the only `spec/` file that may be
  copied out.
- **Confidence:** high · **Effort:** small

## F12 — Nothing says what to do with a correctness observation from the completeness sub-pass
`origin=uvm-review:step-5 severity=medium category=missing-guidance status=open target=.claude/skills/uvm-review/SKILL.md`
- **What happened:** The completeness agent, which has read `PLAN.md` and `TECH.md`, returned an
  unprompted correctness aside about `uvm_lock_mark`'s assignment point. Step 5 says only to append
  its notes to `REVIEW.md`. Promoting the aside would launder plan-informed suspicion into a blind
  verdict; dropping it discards a real observation. I quarantined it as untriaged and said so.
- **Skill cause:** Step 5 defines the sub-pass's remit but not the disposal rule for output beyond it,
  and the isolation it is built on is exactly what makes that output unusable as a finding.
- **Recommended fix:** Tell the sub-pass to mark anything outside its remit explicitly, and tell the
  orchestrator to record such items in `REVIEW.md` as untriaged observations — never as findings, and
  never fed back to a correctness reviewer in this or a later cycle.
- **Confidence:** med · **Effort:** small
